Among the things you can automate with this assistant are opening an app, finding the definition for something, fetching summaries from Wikipedia, searching for files, checking messages, sending emails, asking for dates and times, opening a browser, and others.
However, to use this you'll need to install some Python packages i.e. pyttsx3, speech_recognition, wikipedia, webbrowser, and keyboard.
To install :-
1) Download & install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads (Made in version 3.10.4)
2) Then open CMD with admin privilege and copy paste these commands one by one --> <br>
         → pip install keyboard<br>
         → pip install webbrowser<br>
         → pip install speech_recognition<br>
         → pip install wikipedia<br>
         → pip insall pyttsx3<br>

If any issue persists feel free to post in https://github.com/Sls0n/Desktop-Assistant/issues
This is a work in progress and is only a prototype!
